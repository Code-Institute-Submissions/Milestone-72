<h1>Milestone Project</h1>

This project will be used to display all that I have learned so far. I will be using this project to build a website to describe what i can do and what i attain to do in the future. 
I will be using this website continuously as I learn new skills and adding new features progressively. At this moment in time i may not have all the skills
I would like to have to incorporate all the features that i would like to have in the finished article. I want the website to be easily accessible, simple to navigate and user freindly. 
It must also be displayed for various devices (desktop ,Tablet, Mobile Phone) whilst maintaining a great user experience . Links within the website directing me to other Pages either within this website
or to other social media accounts (youtube etc). I would like to have effects like hover to bring the website alive and encourages interaction

<h3> Design </h3>

Colour scheme

I have used a simple black, grey and white theme. I have used this as it is classic and professional without being dull. The header and footers 
are both grey and consistent throughout all pages. The background is white, with black text. An assortment of images have been used as well that also 
fit the colour theme.

Font

I have used font awesome and used Exo as my primary font and Roboto as my back up fonts. These are both clean professional fonts whilst being attractive.

<Wireframe>

Below are the original wireframe designs I created in my designs. The final version whilst similar doesnt match exactly. This is due to me feeling the image was better
suited below the two divs.

The links in the footer, contact and resume pages all take you to the pages described, in new tabs.
Site is responsive to different device sizes.

<h3> Technologies Used </h3>

I have built my site using: 

<h3>CSS</h3>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS 
CSS allows me to edit and decorate my site in the way I see fit. It gives me the ability to edit my HTML and create classes.

<h3>HTML</h3> 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML 

<h3>Bootstrap (v4.5.3)</h3> 
https://getbootstrap.com/ 
I used Bootstrap because it allowed me to build a responsive website with the limited knowledge and skills I currently have. It was also used in my Nav Bar and
to separate my divs into separate sizes across my site. 

<h3>Balsamiq</h3> 
https://balsamiq.com/# 
I used Balsamiq to help create my template website and try design a quality site. <img src="assets/balsamiq/wireframe.pdf">

<h3>Font Awesome</h3> 
https://fontawesome.com/ 
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

<h3>Google Fonts</h3> 
https://fonts.google.com/
Google fonts were used to import the 'Roboto' 'Exo' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

<h3>jQuery</h3> 
https://jquery.com/ 
jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.

<h3>Testing</h3> 

I have tested my site thoroughly, all the links are working and take the user to the correct pages. 
The contact form is fully functioning, if the user inputs an invalid message into any text field then an error message will appear. For example an 
email address with no @ symbol will bring up an error.
The webpage will respond when used on smaller devices, the nav bar will shrink down into a drop down menu. 

I placed my site throught a CSS Validator which returned no errors <img src="assets/images/CSSValidator.JPG"> 

I have viewed the site on both mobiles and laptop devices. On iPhones I have noticed that the mobile number was automatically made into a clickable link.
Whilst this is a helpful feature to promote interaction, the colour of the link is blue. This is similar to the colour of the background. This doesnt happen on the laptop.
I have tried to remove this using "< meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no">"

<h3>Deployment</h3>

I have used GitHub Pages to deploy the page using the following steps:

<li>I logged in to GitHub and located the GitHub Repository Milestone Project 1</li>
<li>I then clicked the Settings button on the menu.</li>
<li>I scrolled down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" Section.</li>
<li>Under "Source" I selected "Master Branch".</li>
<li>The link was then published in the "GitHub Pages" section.</li>
